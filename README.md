# Twitter Replica

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **Twitter Replica**, a simple social media application where users can:
- Register and log in.
- Post tweets.
- Like or unlike tweets (only logged-in users).
- View tweets dynamically sorted by time and track the number of likes for each tweet.

The application uses **Firebase** as the backend for authentication and Firestore as the database. The frontend is built using **React** and styled with **CSS** for a clean and responsive user interface.
